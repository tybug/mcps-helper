I graduated from MCPS in 2020, so I will no longer be maintaining this repository. You are free to fork/use it for whatever you wish.

# portal-plus
An improvement over the default mcps portal (https://portal.mcpsmd.org/) experience.

Get it on the chrome web store here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/portal%20/lchkjeppckjncjoeckdfgioejgjbcpcd?hl=en

## Features
* Color coding of grades
* Ability to see how a new assignment would impact your grade
* Previously empty percent column is filled in 
* Minor aesthetic positioning adjustments

## Inspiration
This extension was created to mimic the functionality of the [mymcps+ app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mymcps/id1291038640), on browser. The color scheme was chosen to match the app's, which many students are already familiar with.

## Disclaimer
I am not affiliated with Montgomory County nor do I guarantee the accuracy of grades while using this extension.
