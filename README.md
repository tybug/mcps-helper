Viewing your grades will never be something to look forward to, but at least this extension can lessen the pain. 

## Features
* Color coding of grades
* Ability to test a new grade
* Previous empty percent column is filled in 
* Minor aesthetic positioning adjustments

## Inspiration
This extension was created to mimic the functionality of the [mymcps+ app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mymcps/id1291038640), on browser. The color scheme was chosen to match the app's, which many students are already familiar with.

## Disclaimer
The developers of this extension are in no way affiliated with Montgomery County, nor do we guarantee the accuracy of testing new grades.
